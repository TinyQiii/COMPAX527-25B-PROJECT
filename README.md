Project Overview 

The project aims to develop a cloud-based application that tracks, predicts and visualises the 
spread of infectious diseases both globally and locally. The platform utilises publicly available 
datasets on disease statistics and also collects real time data from users such as symptoms 
reporting, locations data and what type of infection it may be. This enables the visualisation of 
infection hotspots, trend predictions, and early warnings for users and public health authorities.
